# Borzoi

## The simpliest data-fetching

Borzoi is a micro Fetch API wrapper that allows you to write less code to achieve better results.

Since Borzoi is currently in pre-alpha, expect changes that may completely change how the library functions.

## Installation

Borzoi works anywhere where Fetch API is present. When using earlier versions of Node, install fetch polyfill.

Install Borzoi using the following command:

```sh
npm install borzoi
```

To determine the project's status Borzoi uses the `process.env.NODE_ENV` environment variable.
